# Algorithms and Data Structures

Edabit, Leetcode and HackerRank Practice Sheet - JavaScript and Python

A collection of completed coding challenges from Edabit, Leetcode, and HackerRank. Challenges contain my own interpretation of various algorithms and data structures such as:

<ul>
  <li>Stacks</li>
<li>Heaps</li>
<li>Hash Maps</li>
<li>Linked Lists</li>
<li>Binary Search Algorithms</li>
<li>Tree Traversals (Pre-order,  inorder etc.)</li>
<li>DFS and BFS</li>
<li>Dynamic Programming</li>
<li>Various Pathfinding Algorithms (A* and Dijkstras)</li>
<li>Backtracking</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
  </ul>

*Completed challenges are present in the practice.py and practice.js files. Each challenge is separated by a hyphen as well as the title of the challenge and the source (Leetcode, HackerRank etc.)

Whilst not working on projects or working on AWS certifications, I use coding challenges as a way of retaining fundamental coding knowledge and to improve my problem-solving ability. I very much enjoy learning about different algorithms and data structures as well as learning about the different approaches and levels of efficiency in solving a problem. I keep to a routine of completing at least one challenge per day.
